    Recently, I found myself looking for a good place to document some of the things I have learned over the years as a NetSuite Functional Administrator, Business Analyst, Project Manager & amatuer coding enthusiast. I started recording some notes in OneNote and then Workflowy, but I thought I should be more public about it so I've decided to periodically post this kind of information to this blog.

Welcome to my NetSuite blog! 

Recently, I found myself looking for a good place to document some of the things I have learned over the years as a NetSuite Functional Administrator, Business Analyst, Project Manager & amatuer coding enthusiast. I started recording some notes in OneNote and then Workflowy, but I thought I should be more public about it so I've decided to periodically post this kind of information to this blog.

I hope share
- Interesting solutions to problems
- Stupid mistakes I have made and how to fix them
- Useful features
- Tools and techniques
- Resources
- etc

I'm not setting any goals for posting. I'm just going to update this from time to time for my own personal benefit and hopefully something I write can be of use to others as well!
