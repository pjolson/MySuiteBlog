# MySuite

A minimalist blog to share  functional tips and tricks about NetSuite that I have learned along the way. 

## How can you contribute?

If you have questions, topic ideas, or would like to post as a guest send an email to [*info@mysuite.tech*](mailto:info@mysuite.tech) and I will get back to you as soon as possible.

## About Me

My name is Patrick Olson and I am a NetSuite SuiteFoundation and Certified Administrator. I have been working in NetSuite as an Administrator, Business Analyst, and Project Manager for over 5 years. My primary experience is in developing business solutions in NetSuite for professional services and manufacturing organizations.

I love to learn and am constantly trying to expand my skill set. I am currently teaching myself SuiteScript 2.0 and will try to share my experience as I go.
